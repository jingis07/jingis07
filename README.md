I am a data enthusiast who loves making business decisions from the insights gotten from data. I have a bachelors degree in Electrical/Electronic Engineering and currently work with one of the power distribution companies in Nigeria. As commercial lead, I used the insights from data analysis to increase revenue collection by 10% and increase staff efficiency and productivity.
For 4 years I have been using tools like Microsoft Excel, Power BI and Tableau, and MSSQL for data analysis, visualization and report writing. These skills I use to contribute to mostly the open-source software and platforms. Examples of platforms analyzed include steemit.com, steemhunt.com, steemstem, etc. Software reviewed include Kodi, Moddle, Telegram, Steeditor, VLC, Gimp, GNS3, Blender among others.
Currently undergoing training on Statistics, Python programming and its data science libraries (Panda, Numpy, Maplotlib etc), and machine learning. With these skills and training, I want to make better data-driven business decisions.
